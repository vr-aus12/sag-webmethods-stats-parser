# SoftwareAG webMethods Stats log parser and plot graph for multiple stats*.log and zip files in the folder


To use the provided Java code for processing and plotting data from log and zip files, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Required Libraries:**

   Ensure that you have the JFreeChart library installed or added to your project's dependencies. You can download it from the [official JFreeChart website](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/).

2. **Create a Java Project:**

   Create a Java project using your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or a text editor.

3. **Add the Provided Java Code:**

   Copy and paste the provided Java code into a new Java class file within your project. Make sure the package structure matches the package name in the code (`package test;`).

4. **Update the Directory Path:**

   In the `main` method, update the `directoryPath` variable with the path to the directory where your log and zip files are located and startswith string. For example:

   ```java
   MultiFileHexDataGraph chart = new MultiFileHexDataGraph("Performance Metrics", "C:\\path\\to\\your\\files\\","stats202309");
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**

   Run the Java application. This will launch a graphical user interface (GUI) with tabs for each metric. The application will automatically process and plot data from log and zip files in the specified directory.

6. **View the Charts:**

   The charts will be displayed in separate tabs based on the metric names. You can switch between tabs to view the charts for different metrics.

8. **Interact with the Charts:**

   You can interact with the charts as you would with any standard charting application. You can zoom in, zoom out, pan, and save charts as images.

9. **Close the Application:**

   Close the application when you are done viewing the charts.

The provided code handles both log and zip files, reads data from them, and dynamically creates and updates charts for each metric. The charts are displayed in a tabbed interface for easy navigation.

Make sure to adjust the `directoryPath` variable in the `main` method to point to your specific directory containing the log and zip files.
